NEWS for version 2.1

Interpreter News
----------------

Syntax enhancements:

   1.  Short circuiting boolean operators:
   
           if ((x == y) || (y == 3) && (x != 4)) ...

       (orelse and andelse are deprecated)
       
   2.  Structure definitions allow embdedded assignment expressions:
   
           s = struct {x = 3, name="foo", a = [1:10]};

   3.  Qualifiers (aka "keywords") added to the language:
   
           save_file ("foo.c"; overwrite=1);
	   plot_points ([1:10], sin([1:10]); color="red", style="solid");

   3.  Expressions such as (a < b < c) now interpreted to mean
       (a<b)and(b<c).

   4.  New keywords: ifnot, then
   
       ifnot may be used instead of !if, which has been deprecated.
       For "then" see the next item.

   5.  Looping constructs support a "then" clause that will get
       executed if the loop runs to completion, e.g.,
       
           loop (20)
	    {
	       if (this ())
	         break;  % The then clause will NOT get executed
	    }
	   then do_that ();
	   
   6.  A floating point array of exactly N elements may be created
       using the form [a:b:#N], where the elements are uniformly
       spaced and run from a to b, inclusive.
       
   7.  References to array elements and structure fields are
       supported, e.g., &A[3], &s.foo.
       
   8.  An exception may be rethrown by calling "throw" without any
       arguments:
       
           try { something (); }
	   catch AnyError: { do_this (); throw; }
